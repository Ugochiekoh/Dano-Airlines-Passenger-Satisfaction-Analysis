## ✅ Conclusion  

This project demonstrates how **data visualization and analytics can translate raw passenger survey data into actionable business strategies**.  

The findings show that Dano Airlines’ overall satisfaction rate (**43.4%**) is weighed down by operational delays, poor digital touchpoints, and weaker service factors such as WiFi and online booking. At the same time, strengths like seat comfort and on-board service provide a solid foundation to build on.  

By acting on the insights — prioritizing WiFi upgrades, simplifying online booking, reducing delays, and tailoring support for first-time and personal travelers — Dano Airlines can significantly lift satisfaction rates and customer loyalty.  

The final Power BI dashboard is designed to be **executive-friendly**: concise, interactive, and focused on the metrics that matter. It not only highlights the challenges but also provides a clear **roadmap for improvement**, making it a practical tool for decision-making at the leadership level.
